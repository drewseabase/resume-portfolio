      <p>
        I’m a frontend developer who builds clean, modern, and responsive websites that help
        businesses clearly communicate their value and convert visitors into customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work focuses on intuitive design, strong visual hierarchy, and mobile-first performance,
        using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to create scalable, maintainable sites.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work closely with clients to translate business goals into polished digital experiences and
        am currently taking on freelance projects for organizations looking to modernize their web presence.
